# DnD-Generator
A WiP Customizable Random Character Generator for DnD 5e

the plan is to be able to Make a almost complete Character sheet for player and NPC alike and have the ablity to add homebrew

### Currently Generates
- Name and Gender
- Class and Level
- Race and Subrace
- Stats with Modifiers, Racial Bonuses, and Ability Score Improvements (STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA)
  - Stats can currently Roll above 20, will be fixed at a later point

### Goals
*In no particular order*
- Generate basic info (name, gender, Class, race, ect.)
- Generate stats with related racial buffs (str, con, wis, ect.)
- Generate related spelles for spell casters
- Make a ui to show all the informaion
- Ability to regenerate a new character 

this may take a bit because i am mostly self tought and find it difficult to read documention
